This Python code is performing data preprocessing on a dataset of movie characters. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Import necessary libraries: The script imports pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.

Load data: The script reads a tab-separated values (TSV) file named "character.metadata.tsv" into a pandas DataFrame. This file contains metadata about movie characters.

Define column names: The script assigns meaningful names to the columns of the DataFrame based on a provided description.

Drop unnecessary columns: The script removes certain columns from the DataFrame that are not needed for further analysis.

Handle missing values: The script replaces all missing values in the DataFrame with an empty string.

Extract year from date: The script extracts the year from the "movie_release_date" column and stores it in a new column "movie_release_year".

Convert to lowercase: The script converts all string values in the DataFrame to lowercase.

Convert age to numeric: The script converts the "actor_age_at_movie_release" column to numeric, ignoring any non-numeric values.

Handle negative age values: The script replaces any negative values in the "actor_age_at_movie_release" column with NaN (Not a Number), as age cannot be negative.

The script uses pandas' built-in functions for most of these tasks, such as read_csv() for loading data, drop() for removing columns, fillna() for handling missing values, applymap() for applying a function to each element of the DataFrame, to_numeric() for converting values to numeric, and apply() for applying a function to each value in a column.



the median age of actors at the time of movie release for each year, and then plots this data. It uses pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.

This Python script loads a movie metadata file into a pandas DataFrame, preprocesses the data, and displays the first few rows of the preprocessed DataFrame. The preprocessing steps include assigning column names, dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, parsing dictionary strings in certain columns, and converting the release date to datetime format.
